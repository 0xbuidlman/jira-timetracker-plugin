                <h3 id="date_modification">Date modification</h3>
                <p>Based on the user settings, there are more options to modify the date. The pop-up calendar and the tools to modify the date can be found in the top left-hand corner. It is possible to increase or decrease the date with units of time (day, week, month). Besides, a date can be chosen from the pop-up calendar also. The inline calendar can be found below the worklog table on the right-hand side of the input fields block. The settings make it possible to use both types of calendars simultaneously.
                    <h4>The Calendar highlights funtion </h4>
                    <p>The calendar coloring function has been extended. The exclude dates shows like weekend (colored with red). The other months weekend fonts is colored to pink. The dates that include worklog now appears with yellow background.</p>

                    <p>The worklog summary can be found in the top right-hand corner and it can be viewed in JIRA format ( d h m) broken down to a given day, week or month. In the case of a given day, the summary is created from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59. In the case of a given week, the summary is created from Monday 00:00:00 to Sunday 23:59:59. A monthly summary is created from the first day of the month 00:00:00 to the last day of the month 23:59:59. The worklogs related to actual work are summarized below the worklog summary. This Real Work Summary contains only the time spent with actual work based on the worklogs that are not related to non-working issues. The Real Work Summary uses Jira format (d h m) to display the daily, weekly and monthly summaries.</p>

                        <p>Global settings may be accessed only by the system administrators. The administrator can find the Global settings menu item on the Administrator page under the Plugins or Add-ons menu in the Timetracker submenu.</p>

                            <h4>Non-Working issues</h4> The administrator can define a list that may contain issue keys and regular expressions. This list will be the list of non-working issues. The issues listed here are ignored when creating the Real Work Summary. By default, the Non-Working issues list is empty.
                            <h4>Non-Estimated issues</h4> The administrator can define a list that may contain issue keys and regular expressions. This list will be the list of Non-Estimated issues. The issues listed here do not trigger the appearance of the red exclamation mark and they are ignored when sending notification e-mails too. All the issues are non-estimated by default. This can be achieved by setting upf a .* regular expression. Example: To set up all the issues of MYPROJECT to be Non-estimated, the following regular expression needs to be used: “MYPROJECT-.*”.
                            <h4>Working days</h4> By default, weekdays are working days and weekends are non-working days. The administrator can define the list of days that are exceptions to the rule; these lists are empty by default. The format of the dates is yyyy-MM-dd (e.g.: 2013-01-01), the separator character is “,”.
                            <ul>

                <h2>Notification email</h2>
                <p>By default, the plugin sends every day at 20:00 a notification email about the issues to which worklogs have been assigned if the estimated time of the issues is over and if the issues have not been closed. The notification email is delivered to the reporter of the issue and to the project manager. If multiple worklogs have been assigned to one issue, they have exceeded the Estimated Time and they have not been closed, then the plugin will send only an email. The plugin does not send emails about issues that are defined as non-estimated in the global settings.
